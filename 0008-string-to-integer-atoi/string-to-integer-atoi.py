Q: "How would you handle decimal points or scientific notation?"
Answer: For decimal points, stop at the decimal (e.g., "3.14" â†’ 3). For scientific notation, you'd need to parse the mantissa and exponent separately.

Q: "How would you implement this without using built-in functions like isdigit()?"
Answer: Check if character is between '0' and '9': '0' <= c <= '9'
